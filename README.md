This is a tool for modifying virtual reality demos created for the Oculus Rift DK2 (developer kit 2). It makes binary modifications to the plug-in DLL in order to achieve certain effects like altered chromatic abberation and warping. To use it, build the C# project, and place the resulting binary in the "originaldlls" directory and execute it.
